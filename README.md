# EasyContactForms - A Backend for Contact Forms

Welcome to the readme file for the EasyContactForms program built with Spring Boot. This application allows you to store
or forward contact form submissions via a REST endpoint. Below you will find important information regarding the setup
and usage of the program.

## Functionality

The EasyContactForms Backend utilizes a REST endpoint to receive and process form submissions. The endpoint expects a
POST request with the necessary fields for the contact form entry. Once a request is received, it will either be stored
in a relational database or forwarded to the specified email address.

## Example
There are multiple data types accepted by the endpoint including a simple HTML Form as followed.
```html
<form method="post" action="{{host}}/contact">
   <!-- minimal accepted request information -->
  <label>Email
    <input type="email" name="email">
  </label>
  <br>
  <label>Message
    <input type="text" name="message">
  </label>
  <br>
   <!-- Redirect information for the server given as hidden input fields -->
  <input type="hidden" name="redirect" value="{{urlSuccess}}"/>
  <input type="hidden" name="redirectError" value="{{urlError}}"/>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

There are some variables used in the snippet which are explained bellow:

- host: Base url of the EasyContactForms server including port
- urlSuccess: redirect url to the static website if action was performed successful
- urlError: redirect url to the static website if action terminated with errors

## Requirements

### Productive

- Java Version >= 17

### Development

- Java Version >= 17
- Gradle Version >= 7
- Docker

## Startup

Start from jar file:

```bash
java -jar EasyContactForms-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Compile from source:

1. Ensure that you have Java and Gradle installed on your system.

2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Jan222333444/EasyContactForms).

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd EasyContactForms
   ```

4. Build the system:

   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Configuration

### Productive

With jar file:

1. Start the application via terminal/powershell
   - this will create all needed directories in the directory of the jar file
   - the application will add the default configuration to the config folder

2. Configure the following properties according to your requirements:

   - Specify the database connection URL, username, and password for storing the form submissions otherwise they will be stored locally in a file.
   - Set the email settings to forward submissions to a particular email address.
      - You will need an email account from which this application will send the contact requests to your destination
        email
3. Set up a proxy (e.g. nginx) or add a ssl certificate to encrypt traffic
   - for a selfsigned certificate you can run the make target ``sslCertificate``

4. You can deactivate redirect to email by setting the configuration option ``redirect.mode=email`` to ``redirect.mode=none``


If self compiled: 

1. Copy the file ````example.application.properties```` into ``application.properties``

2. Configure the following properties according to your requirements:
   
   - Specify the database connection URL, username, and password for storing the form submissions.
   - Set the email settings to forward submissions to a particular email address.
      - You will need an email account from which this application will send the contact requests to your destination
        email 
3. Set up a proxy (e.g. nginx) or add a ssl certificate to encrypt traffic

4. You can deactivate redirect to email by setting the configuration option ``redirect.mode=email`` to ``redirect.mode=none``

### Development

1. Open the ``dev.application.properties`` file located in the ``config`` directory.

2. If you want to use another database then H2 for development configure it here.

3. Copy the ``dev.application.properties`` to ``application.properties``

4. Run the Make target ``sslCertificate`` to generate selfsigned certificates for development

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

2. The application will start on port 8080 by default. If you wish to change the port, update the "
   application.properties" file accordingly.

3. Send a POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/contact` with the required form data. Ensure that you
   include the correct fields and data format.

4. It is recommended to set up a proxy server to enable HTTPS. This is needed especially in context of the GDPR(General
   Data Protection Regulation) of the EU.

### Development

Additionally, you will need to start the smtp4dev server over Docker.

````bash
docker compose up -d
````

For insight into the architecture of this application, checkout the docs folder with the API definition and some UML-Diagrams

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during installation or usage of the application, please check the error logs and console
  output for any error messages or warnings.

- Verify that all configuration parameters are set correctly, including the database connection and email settings.

## Plugin development

To develop a plugin implement the Plugin Interface from the ``PluginAPI`` subproject

You also need to implement the ``PluginFactory`` of this subproject and link it inside your implementation of the ``Plugin`` interface.

Last step is to add the file ``org.easycontactforms.api.Plugin`` with the full name of your Plugin implementation (including package path)
inside the ``resources/META-INF/services`` directory of your Gradle or Maven project.

An example is given in the ``TestPlugin`` subproject.
