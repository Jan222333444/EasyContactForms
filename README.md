# EasyContactForms - A Backend for Contact Forms

Welcome to the readme file for the EasyContactForms program built with Spring Boot. This application allows you to store
or forward contact form submissions via a REST endpoint. Below you will find important information regarding the setup
and usage of the program.

## Functionality

The EasyContactForms Backend utilizes a REST endpoint to receive and process form submissions. The endpoint expects a
POST request with the necessary fields for the contact form entry. Once a request is received, it will either be stored
in a relational database or forwarded to the specified email address.

## Requirements

### Productive

- Java Version >= 17
- Gradle Version >= 7

### Development

- Java Version >= 17
- Gradle Version >= 7
- Docker

## Installation

Compile from source:

1. Ensure that you have Java and Gradle installed on your system.

2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Jan222333444/EasyContactForms).

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd EasyContactForms
   ```

4. Build the system:

   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Configuration

### Productive

1. Copy the file ````example.application.propterties```` into ``application.properties``

2. Configure the following properties according to your requirements:
   
   - Specify the database connection URL, username, and password for storing the form submissions.
   - Set the email settings to forward submissions to a particular email address.
      - You will need an email account from which this application will send the contact requests to your destination
        email 
3. Set up a proxy (e.g. nginx) to encrypt traffic

You can deactivate redirect to email by setting the configuration option ``redirect.mode=email`` to ``redirect.mode=none``

### Development

1. Open the ``dev.application.properties`` file located in the ``config`` directory.

2. If you want to use another database then H2 for development configure it here.

3. Copy the ``dev.application.properties`` to ``application.properties``

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

2. The application will start on port 8080 by default. If you wish to change the port, update the "
   application.properties" file accordingly.

3. Send a POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/contact` with the required form data. Ensure that you
   include the correct fields and data format.

4. It is recommended to set up a proxy server to enable HTTPS. This is needed especially in context of the GDPR(General
   Data Protection Regulation) of the EU.

### Development

Additionally, you will need to start the smtp4dev server over Docker.

````bash
docker compose up -d
````


## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during installation or usage of the application, please check the error logs and console
  output for any error messages or warnings.

- Verify that all configuration parameters are set correctly, including the database connection and email settings.

## Plugin development

To develop a plugin implement the Plugin Interface from the ``PluginAPI`` subproject

You also need to implement the ``PluginFactory`` of this subproject and link it inside your implementation of the ``Plugin`` interface.

Last step is to add the file ``org.easycontactforms.api.Plugin`` with the full name of your Plugin implementation (including package path)
inside the ``resources/META-INF/services`` directory of your Gradle or Maven project.

An example is given in the ``TestPlugin`` subproject.
